Consistency Levels

Should allow the application to set various levels of consistency, on the lines of fopen's (O_SYNC).

Each DB write can be called SUCCESS or FAIL on various levels like:

\begin{itemize}
\item One node's memory
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item One node's disk
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Quorum's designated replicated level
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item All nodes
\end{itemize}

Should we even allow a driver to set the last one ?

The driver can choose the consistency level on a per-connection basis or on a per-command basis. For example, all writes should be at ONE consistency level whereas all reads need to be at Quorum consistency level.

What is eventual consistency ? Explain.
