\section{Filesystem && Database :: Husband && Wife}


A filesystem and a database is a match made in Heaven. I leave it to you to decide what component does which spousal role, though. Synergistic will be a word that will aptly define the combination of the filesystem and the database. Just like every other marriage, this filesystem and database integeration too needs a lot of time, effort, careful planning and love. If we design badly, we may endup with a system where both the filesystem and the database may be doing the same thing redundantly or both may skip important tasks.

We can ask the database to merely write the files to a distributed filesystem and let the fs take care of the distributedness.
