\section{Filesystem && Database :: Husband && Wife}


A filesystem and a database is a match made in Heaven. I leave it to you to decide what component does which spousal role, though. Synergistic will be a word that will aptly define the combination of the filesystem and the database. Just like every other marriage, this filesystem and database integeration too needs a lot of time, effort, careful planning and love. If we design badly, a filesystem and a database may both do the same thing redundantly or both may skip important tasks.
