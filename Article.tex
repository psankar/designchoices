\section{Introduction}

A distributed database system, generically designed to work with reasonable performance, on any type of load, will be comparitively inefficient to a distributed database system designed specifically to suit the storage requirements of the applications that will be built on top. In this paper, We present a few design choices which should be considered, not only while designing a distributed database system, but also while choosing a existing distributed database system for the storage needs of your applications. None of these design choices are inherently inferior or superior. The weightage for the individual choices should be dictated by the needs of your application. We have tried to present various design choices and used industry established HBase and Cassandra systems to show some of the contrasts.
