\section{Load on the Database}

The choice of the datastructures and the design of the individual components of a database system depends a lot on the load on the database. The estimated \textbf{Queries Per Second (QPS)} numbers for the load on the database during average load and peak load, the duration for which the peak loads will continue will all come in handy.

More than the number of the calls that the database receives, the ratio of the type of the database calls plays a big factor in choosing a design. We can roughly classify the type of the database calls to three buckets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Insert: To create new records (write)
\item Modify: To modify an existing record (write/delete)
\item Select: To fetch a record, optionally based on a condition (read)
\end{itemize}

If the database will spend more than 99\% of the time on writes (say a logging application), then a Log Structured Merge Tree \cite{O_Neil_1996} may be effective; conversely, if 99\% of the time will be on reads, then memory maps may prove to be more efficient. So, understanding the application need is very important while designing a distributed database. Even while choosing an existing database, having knowledge about the nature of the database workload by the application(s) on top will be useful.

Facebook started the Cassandra\cite{Lakshman_2009} distributed database project initially to perform well during parallel writes and later switched to HBase as they started running more data mining queries on the huge bigdata datasets that they have accumulated.
