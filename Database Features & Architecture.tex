\section{Database Features & Architecture}

\begin{itemize}
\item Key value store vs multi-column store ?
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Row store vs columnar storage ?
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Primary key generation ? Should DB support it or will the Application handle it ?
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Node specific unique keys to fasten primary key generation ?
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Distributed Transactions ?
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Materialized Views support ?
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Stored procedures support ? PL/SQL like ?
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Support for Foreign keys ? Referential integrity ? Graph like relationship storage ?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{In-Memory Nature}
Caching ?
memory-only database ?
Distributed nature only in memory but stored in disk in only a few machines ?

\subsection{Scalability}
The relationship between increasing the number of nodes and the corresponding level of increase in the performance (Talk about Amdahl's law imposed limits, 10 women cannot deliver a baby in one month etc.)
